1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:03,047
have you ever been in an argument about
nuclear power

2
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:06,336
we have and we found it frustrating and
confusing

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,780
so let's try and get to grips with this
topic wall

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:14,044
done

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,758
of it all started in the nineteen
forties

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,135
after the shock and horror the wall in
the use of the atomic bomb

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,080
nuclear energy promise to be a peaceful
spinoff love the new technology

8
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,027
helping the world get back on its feet
everyone's

9
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:31,190
imagination was running wild would an
atrocity become frame

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,023
could nuclear power help settle the
antarctic would there be nuclear powered

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:36,800
cars

12
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:41,030
planes all houses it seems that this was
just a few years of hard work away

13
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:45,017
one thing was certain: the future was

14
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:49,078
atomic just a few years later there was
a sort of Atomic Age Hanover

15
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:52,747
as it turned out nuclear power was a
very complicated

16
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,660
and very expensive turning physics into

17
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:59,117
engineering was easy on paper but hard
in real life

18
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:03,866
also private companies thought the
nuclear power was much too risky

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,340
as an investment most of them would much
rather stick with gas

20
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,117
coal and oil but there were many people
who didn't just want to abandon the

21
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:12,396
promise of the Atomic Age

22
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,020
an exciting new technology the prospect
to enormously cheap

23
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:20,024
electricity the prospective being
independent oil and gas imports

24
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:23,333
and in some cases a secret desire to
possess

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,700
atomic weapons provided a strong
motivation to keep going

26
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:31,386
nuclear power supply finest hour finally
came in the early nineteen seventies

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,108
when war in the Middle East caused oil
prices to skyrocket worldwide

28
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:39,423
now commercial interest and investment
picked up on it.

29
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,670
dazzling pace more than harmful all the
nuclear reactors in the world

30
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:48,126
were built between 1970 in 1985 but
which typeof reacted to build

31
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,800
given how many different types there
were to choose from a surprising

32
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,270
underdog candidate won the day

33
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:57,031
the light water reactor it wasn't very
innovative

34
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,122
and it wasn't too popular with
scientists but it had some decisive

35
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:01,106
advantages

36
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:06,065
it was there it works and it wasn't
terribly expensive

37
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,690
so what does a light-water reactor do
well

38
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,094
the basic principle is shockingly simple
it heats up water

39
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:16,176
using an artificial chain reaction
nuclear fission releases several million

40
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,084
times more energy than any chemical
reaction could

41
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,069
rainy heavy elements on the brink of
stability like uranium 235

42
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,115
get bombarded with neutrons the neutron
is absorbed

43
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,037
but the resulting is unstable most to
the time

44
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:34,085
it immediately spits into fast-moving
blaze ornaments some

45
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,814
additional free neutrons and energy in
the form of radiation

46
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,250
the radiation heats the surrounding
water while the neutrons repeat the

47
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:42,100
process with

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,359
other items releasing more neutrons and
radiation in a closely controlled chain

49
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:47,425
reaction

50
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,072
very different from the fast destructive
runaway reaction

51
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,030
in an atomic bomb in our light-water
reactor

52
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:58,832
a moderator is needed to control the
neutrons energy simple

53
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,900
ordinary water does the job which is
very practical since water is used right

54
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,064
the turbines anyway

55
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:07,097
the light water reactor became prevalent
because it's simple and cheap

56
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:10,109
however it's neither the safest most
efficient

57
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,025
know technically elegant nuclear reactor
the renewed nuclear Hyde

58
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,066
lasted barely a decade though in 1979

59
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:21,127
the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania barely escaped a

60
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:22,106
catastrophe

61
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:27,050
when it's called mounted in 1986 the
Chernobyl catastrophe directly

62
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,044
threatened Central Europe with a
radioactive cloud

63
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:33,158
banded 2011 the drawn-out Fukushima
disaster sparks new discussions and

64
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:34,136
concerns

65
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:40,071
while in the nineteen eighties 218 new
nuclear power reactors went live

66
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:43,157
their number and nucleus global share of
the electricity production

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,059
has stagnated since the end of the
eighties

68
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:50,059
so what's the situation today today

69
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:53,157
nuclear energy meets around 10 percent
to the world's energy demand

70
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:57,064
that are about 439 nuclear reactors

71
00:03:57,064 --> 00:04:02,067
in 31 countries about 70 new reactors
under construction in 2015

72
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,108
most at the main countries which are
growing quickly all in all

73
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,059
160 new reactors are planned worldwide

74
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,082
most nuclear reactors will build more
than 25 years ago

75
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:15,117
with pretty old technology more than
eighty percent

76
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:17,073
are various times in life

77
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:20,168
water reactor today many countries are
faced with the choice

78
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:25,093
the expensive replacement of the aging
reactors possibly with more efficient

79
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:25,121
but

80
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:29,059
last tested models or a move away from
nuclear power

81
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,078
towards Newark or older technology was
different cost

82
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:36,096
and environmental impacts so should we
use nuclear energy

83
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:40,112
